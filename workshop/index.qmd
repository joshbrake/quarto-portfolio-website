title: How to Make Your Own Portfolio Website Using Quarto

## Why to make a portfolio website?

A portfolio website is a great way to maximize your luck surface area.
If you do a lot of great stuff but nobody knows about it, it's significantly less valuable to you and to others.
A portfolio website helps to remedy that situation by creating a venue for you to show your work.

The mathematical below demonstrates why I think this is important.
The blog post linked below gives a deeper explanation.

## How to Make It

This [slide deck](/slides/) walks you through how to create your portfolio website using a open-source scientific publishing tool called [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).
There are many different tools and platforms available and you should just pick one rather than spend too much time deliberating.
However, I like Quarto for several reasons:

- All the code for your website is written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/).
- The markdown format makes it very amenable to tracking in a version control tool like Git.
- You can easily publish for free on Github Pages with a one-liner from the command line.
- Quarto handles math formatting, figure captions, and references with ease.

## How to Publish It

The trickiest part of making your portfolio website is the last step of getting it live on the web.
I've recorded a quick video tutorial below to show you how.
The [Quarto docs](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html) are also very helpful resource on this point.
